This project utilizes the [BCI Competition III Dataset IVa](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/desc_IVa.html) to classify 2 motor imageries:
- Right hand movements
- Right foot movements

## Loading Data

## Preprocessing 

## Epoching

## Feature Extraction using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)

Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) extracts spatial patterns that maximize variance differences between two classes, such as right hand vs. foot motor imagery.
